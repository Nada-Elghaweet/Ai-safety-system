# **AI Safety System — Intelligent Audio-Visual Critical Event Detection**

## **Project Description**

Traditional surveillance systems rely mainly on human operators, which often leads to delayed responses or missed incidents—especially in high-pressure environments. Our project solves this problem by introducing an **AI-powered safety and security system** that can automatically detect **critical or abnormal events** using **audio-visual analysis**.

The system processes **video streams and environmental sounds** at the same time, allowing it to identify emergencies such as:

* Violence or physical fights
* Loud crashes or breaking objects
* Fire or smoke presence
* Distress screams
* Abnormal movements or behaviors

Once a critical event is detected, the system generates **real-time alerts**, enabling faster decision-making and response. This improves **situational awareness**, enhances safety, reduces the dependence on human monitoring, and increases the overall reliability of surveillance environments such as campuses, factories, hospitals, or public spaces.
